ZAP:
---------
OWASP ZAP Tutorial : -
Zed Attack Proxy(ZAP)
Notes: https://www.zaproxy.org/getting-started/
What is ZAP?
A tool to find vulnerabilities in a Web Application.
It is Open Source and completely FREE
Cross Platform – Windows, Linux and Macs
 
Features:
Intercepting Proxy
Spider
Passive Scan
Active Scan
Fuzzing
Reports
ZAP Extensions
Dynamic SSL Certificates
 
https://www.zaproxy.org/download/
 
2: ZAP Installing Dynamic SSL Certificate.
Step 1: Open the OWASP ZAP Tool
Step 2: Click on no, I do not want to persist the session of now
             Click on Remember my choice.
Step 3: Go to Tools options-----??Options--??Network->server certificate->Dynamic SSL Certificate -??Save it--??Select a folder??cancle/ok

Step 4: Close the OWASP ZAP tool and open Firefox browser
Go to setting------??privacy and security -----??view certificates---??import button-??select the folder??add certificate??trusted certificate click it??import it successfully 

Same as JMeter import the certificates and you can import certificate for other browsers as well.
This is necessary so that you can navigate to various applications/website in zap 

Intercepting Proxy
-----------------------
Browser -----------??OWASP ZAP-------------??Web Application.
 
Step 1: Open OWASP ZAP Tool-----??At footer proxy port 8080 will be started,-??Go to options-----??tools----??Network ---??Local Proxy

step2:Configure on firefox ->network settings->Port 8081, HttpProxy : localhost

Admin@1234
 
5: Configuration FoxProxy with Zap
Step 1: open FireFox and go to network settings-------?? click to No proxy settings. (Make sure that no proxy settings in on). Then open new tab on firefox and type Firefox add on, hit enter----?? search box : FoxyProxy Standard--??Add to FireFox.
 
Now open OWASP ZAP Tool and check local proxy settings and as per that settings add data into FoxyProxy extension.
 
Open FoxyProxy extension ----??options---??proxies---------??add ------??add data there.

title : ZAPNetwork
 
localhost
 
8081

Go to new tab of firefox browser now, open any website, parallel open OWASP ZAP tool with that and see no recording is going on but, when you will enable the ZAPNetwork from Firefox browser extension then, it will show that Network as well as start recordings also.
 
Extension----??click on ZAPNetwork, Refresh that website again, then it will record all requests.
has context menu

Actually we are intercepting login request here,
Now here, we are able to see the credential, and if we changed the password from zap tool then, your credentials will be changed and you will not able to open the application, this is often called Man-In-The-Middle-Attack.
 
Note: Try for the application to which you have the permission , please don't try for anyone else account.


Intercepting Specific Requests with OWASP ZAP
 
Step 1 : Example: Intercepting a specific api request with zap tool.
 
Step 1: Open Firefox browser----??enable FroxyProxy ZAP Network----??Open Zap Tool-----??Open hematite quiz app on firefox-----??On zap tool, It will start recodring all requests.
 
Click on questions tab : zap tool will record it
Right Click on that request in zap tool-------??show in site tab--??right click in site tab on request??Break.
 
Here If I chaged the String, then in the quiz app the question tab/ api will not work.
And in information window, you will see new tab added that is breakpoint, where you can see all added breakpoints.
 
Note: Do not perfornm practically it will change the settings in Quiz App.
 
 
Manual Explore for Vulnerability Assessment in OWASP ZAP
Step 1: Open zap -??click on Manual Explore option on the workbench
 
Spidering a website with OWASP ZAP
 
Spidering allows you to launch an automated scan against an application.
Spider explores by findings links in html pages.
It begins with set of URLs called Seeds
The Spider then visits these URL’s, identifies all the hyperlinks in the pages.
Add them to the list of URLs to visit
The process continues recursively as long as new resources are found
 
Step 1: Open zap tool
Click on plus icon in the information window and click on spider.
Click on new scan, spider dialog window
 
 
scan progress
 
Manual Explore, spdiring - exploring, active scan, automated scan
 
Passive scan rules define what kind of vulnerabilities to check for in the background.
Application Errors
Coockie without samesite Attribute.
Cookie Domain Script inclusion
Information Disclosure in URL
Information Disclosure in Comments
 
 
Open zap tool-----??tools-------??
options----??passive scan rules--??
Threshold = High---??fewer potantials issues will be raised
                     Medium -??Avarage potential issues will be raised
                     Low--?? maximum potential issues will be raised.
options----??passive scanner--?? Here we can configure if needed, can set max alerts ranges etc.


Selenium WebDriver:
-----------------------------
ID
Name
ClassName
LinkText
Partial LinkText
TagName
CSS Selector
XPath
 
Locating by ID
----------------------
 
This is the most common way of locating elements since ID’s are supposed to be unique for each element.
 
Target Format: id=id of the element
 
id = email
----------------------------------
 
Locating by Name
Locating elements by name are very similar to locating by ID, except that we use the “name=” prefix instead.
 
Target Format: name=name of the element
 
name=username
---------------------------------------
Locating by Link Text
This type of CSS locator in Selenium applies only to hyperlink texts. We access the link by prefixing our target with “link=” and then followed by the hyperlink text.
 
Target Format: link=link_text
---------------------------------------
Locating by XPath
XPath is the language used when locating XML (Extensible Markup Language) nodes. Since HTML can be thought of as an implementation of XML, we can also use XPath in locating HTML elements.
 
Formula :
 
XPath = //tagname[@Attribute=’Value’] 
---------------------------------------
css path : formula
 
Syntax:
 
css=(HTML tag)([attribute$=end of the string])
1
css=(HTML tag)([attribute$=end of the string])

has context menu
