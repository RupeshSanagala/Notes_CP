: Introduction and SetUp.
-------------------------------
Mocha – Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js
Pre-requisite – Node, VSCode, ES6 Mocha and Chai Snippets for Visual Studio Code
 
Steps:
Open the terminal, create a project directory, move into it and run npm init –y
Run npm i mocha chai
Create a test folder
Change script test key to have value mocha
Create a src folder and create an app.js file
Create test.js file
 
 
Open package.json file and type test : ‘mocha’ and save it. Every time you make changes save it compulsory
 
Inside create src folder create a file app.js
Inside test folder create a file app.spec.js
 
Synchronous Test Cases describe it, context, specify, suite and test – BDD & TDD 
 
Steps:
Add functions and export the same
Write tests into test file using ‘Describe’ and ‘It’ blocks – BDD or ‘Context’ and ‘Specify’
Write tests into test file using ‘Suite’ and ‘Test’ blocks – TDD
Run Tests using npm test
 
Tdd is developer centre, bdd is user-centric
 
 
Behavior Driven Development
	
Test Driven Development


Behavior Driven Development is a development technique which focuses more on a software application’s behavior.
	
Test Driven Development is a development technique which focuses more on the implementation of a feature of a software application/product.


In BDD the participants are Developers, Customer, QAs.
	
In TDD the participants are developers.


Mainly it creates an executable specification that fails because the respective feature doesn’t exist, then writing the simplest code that can make the specification pass and as a result we get the required behavior implemented
 in the system.
	
Mainly it refers to write a test case that fails because the specified functionality doesn’t exist and after that update the code that can make the test case pass and as a result we get the feature implemented in the system.


Its main focus is on system requirements.
	
Its main focus is on unit test.


In BDD the starting point is a scenario.
	
In TDD the starting point is a test case.


It is a team methodology.
	
It is a development practice.


Here language used to write behavior/scenarios is simple English language.
	
Here language is used is similar to the one used for feature development like programming language.


In BDD collaboration is required between all the stakeholders.
	
In TDD collaboration is required only between the developers.


It is a good approach for project development which are driven by user actions.
	
It is a good approach for projects which involve API and third-party tools.


Some of the tools used are  Cucumber, Dave, JBehave, Spec Flow,  Concordian, BeanSpec etc.
	
Some of the tools used are  JBehave, JDave, Cucumber, Spec Flow, BeanSpec, FitNesse etc.

Steps:
Check command line usage
Run tests using npm test with an example of –fgrep, grep
--timeout 50000 –parallel –bail –f ‘async’
 
-f, -g = testfilters
Regression Testing we can use this.

Generate Mochaesome Report
Steps:
From terminal install mochawesome report ‘npm I mochawesome’
Run from command line “mocha test\async_test.js –reporter mochawesome –reporter-options reportDir=customReportDir,reportFilename = customReportFilename”
Add to scripts
“scripts”:{
“test”: “mocha –spec.\\test\\*.js –reporter mochawesome –reporter- options reportDir=customReportDir,reportFilename=customReportFilename
}
